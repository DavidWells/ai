# Create .http files to Interact with our API endpoints.

**Your task: Is to take our API endpoints that are listed and create the .http file for us to use in our editor to make those requests.**

Follow this process:

1.  **Identify Recent Project Developments:**
    - Review information about recently completed tasks (e.g., from `docs/tasks/`, task management systems if accessible, or summarized in recent discussions).
    - Examine recent commit history for significant changes to code, features, or configurations.
    - Consider any new features added or bugs fixed that might impact documentation.

2.  **Thoroughly Review Documentation:**
    - Read all files located within the `docs/` directory and its subdirectories.
    - Pay close attention to READMEs, guides, architectural documents, and usage instructions.

3.  **Then create the API documentation following the output instructions below. Ensure the Formatting is followed**

**Output:**

The output should follow the spec from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient/refs/heads/master/README.md

See below for instructions on what the `.http` files should look like.

## Formatting

ALWAYS have new blank likes above `\`\`\`http` blocks and Always have a blank line below markdown headers

For example, this output is wrong because `### Get a specific todo` is missing an extra empty line before `GET {{baseUrl}}/todos/1`

```md
### Get a specific todo
GET {{baseUrl}}/todos/1
```

And this example is correct because the new line exists

```md
### Get a specific todo

GET {{baseUrl}}/todos/1
```

# HTTP Request File Guide

REST Client allows you to send HTTP requests and view responses in Visual Studio Code. Create files with `.http` or `.rest` extensions to get started.

## Basic Request Format

The simplest request is just a URL:

```http
https://example.com/comments/1
```

Or follow the standard RFC 2616 format with method, headers, and body:

```http
POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "name": "sample",
    "time": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT"
}
```

## Request Structure

### Request Line

The first non-empty line defines the request:

```http
GET https://example.com/comments/1 HTTP/1.1
GET https://example.com/comments/1
https://example.com/comments/1
```

If no method is specified, GET is assumed.

### Query Parameters

Write query strings inline:

```http
GET https://example.com/comments?page=2&pageSize=10
```

Or spread across multiple lines:
```http
GET https://example.com/comments
    ?page=2
    &pageSize=10
```

### Headers

Add headers after the request line, one per line:

```http
POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: rest-client
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Request Body
Add a blank line after headers, then include the body:

```http
POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "sample",
    "time": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT"
}
```

## Multiple Requests

Separate multiple requests with `###`:

```http
GET https://example.com/comments/1 HTTP/1.1

###

GET https://example.com/topics/1 HTTP/1.1

###

POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "name": "sample",
    "time": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT"
}
```

## Variables

### File Variables

Define variables at the file level:

```http
@hostname = api.example.com
@port = 8080
@host = {{hostname}}:{{port}}
@contentType = application/json

###

GET https://{{host}}/authors HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: {{contentType}}
```

### Request Variables

Name requests to reference their responses:

```http
# @name login
POST https://api.example.com/login HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass"
}

###

@authToken = {{login.response.headers.Authorization}}

# @name getProfile
GET https://api.example.com/profile HTTP/1.1
Authorization: {{authToken}}
```

### System Variables

Use built-in dynamic variables:

```http
POST https://api.example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "{{$guid}}",
    "timestamp": "{{$timestamp}}",
    "created": "{{$datetime iso8601}}",
    "random": "{{$randomInt 1 100}}"
}
```

Available system variables:
- `{{$guid}}` - Generate UUID
- `{{$timestamp}}` - Current timestamp  
- `{{$datetime iso8601}}` - Current datetime in ISO8601 format
- `{{$randomInt min max}}` - Random integer between min and max

## Authentication

### Basic Auth
```http
GET https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic user passwd
```

### Bearer Token
```http
GET https://api.example.com/data HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here
```

## File References

Reference external files for request bodies:

```http
POST https://example.com/upload HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/xml

< ./request-body.xml
```

Use `<@` to process variables in the file:

```http
POST https://example.com/upload HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/xml

<@ ./request-body-with-variables.xml
```

## Sending Requests
- Click "Send Request" link above the request
- Use `Ctrl+Alt+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+R` (macOS)
- Right-click and select "Send Request"
- Press `F1` and type "Rest Client: Send Request"
